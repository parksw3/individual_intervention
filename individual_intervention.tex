\section{Introduction}

\jd{The definitions are well done -- but I would like to play with them if I get a chance.}
The reproduction number \RR---typically defined as the average number of new infections caused by an infected individual---is a key characteristic of an emerging epidemic.
Its value in a fully susceptible population---the \emph{basic} reproduction number, \Ro---provides information about whether a pathogen can invade, the level of intervention required to prevent invasion, and the final size of an epidemic \citep{diekmann1990definition,anderson1991infectious}.
When an epidemic is ongoing, transmission dynamics are affected by changes in population-level immunity, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and contact patterns---
these changes in transmission dynamics can be described by $\RR(t)$, often referred to as the \emph{effective} or \emph{time-dependent} reproduction number \citep{wallinga2004different, fraser2007estimating, cori2013new}.
Interpretation and estimation of $\RR(t)$ have been a key area of research during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to its policy implications \citep{pan2020association,flaxman2020estimating,gostic2020practical}.

One of the main challenges in interpreting $\RR(t)$ can be attributed, in part, to its standard definition: the average number of new infections caused by an infected individual.
While this definition is biologically intuitive, it is mathematically imprecise as time-dependent reproduction numbers can be defined in multiple ways, depending on the cohort (e.g., a group of individuals who developed symptoms or were infected at the same time) and the types of transmission scenarios (i.e., realized or counterfactual transmission processes).
Here, we primarily focus on two main measures of transmission that look at a cohort of infectees or infectors that were infected at the same time: the instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$ and the case reproduction number $\Rc(t)$.

First, the instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$---popularized by \cite{cori2013new}---was initially defined as the average number of new infections that an individual infected at time $t$ (i.e., an individual from a cohort of infectees) will generate over the course of their infection if conditions at time $t$ remain unchanged \citep{fraser2007estimating}. 
We further note that $\Ri(t)$ does not actually depend on when the person gets infected, only on when the conditions are held constant at---that is, if we ``freeze'' conditions at time $t$, anyone who become infected after time $t$ will cause same number of infections on average.
Therefore, the instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$ characterizes transmission conditions at time $t$ and provides a real-time estimate of whether the disease will continue to spread if conditions were to stay the same \citep{gostic2020practical}.
However, since transmission dynamics change throughout an epidemic, $\Ri(t)$ is a counterfactual measure and must be interpreted with care.

On the other hand, the case reproduction number $\Rc(t)$---popularized by \cite{wallinga2004different}---corresponds to the average number of new infections that an individual infected at time $t$ generated over the course of their infection.
$\Rc(t)$ is a realized measure, which depends on conditions after time $t$ and can only be estimated retrospectively.
Although the verbal definition for $\RR(t)$ (``the average number of new infections caused by an infected individual'') closely resembles that of $\Rc(t)$, its mathematical definitions derived from compartmental models (e.g., basic reproduction multiplied by the proportion susceptible) actually correspond to that of $\Ri(t)$ \citep{gostic2020practical}.
Due to the imprecision of the verbal definition of $\RR(t)$, the counterfactual quality of $\Ri(t)$ (and therefore, $\RR(t)$) is often neglected in its interpretation---
specifically, in contrast to a widely accepted view, $\Ri(t) > 1$ or $<1$ does not provide information about whether the number of infections is increasing or decreasing at time $t$.

Estimating $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$ requires knowledge of true incidence of infection $i(t)$ and the generation-interval distribution $g(\tau)$, where generation intervals describe time between infections of an infector and an infectee \citep{svensson2007note}.
Here, we focus on the latter: which generation-interval distributions do we need to correctly estimate $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$?
Current frameworks for estimating of $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$, including widely-used software such as EpiEstim, rely on a time-independent distribution to estimate $\Ri(t)$ throughout the entire epidemic \citep{cori2013new}.
\cite{gostic2020practical} recently suggested that the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (measuring the intrinsic infectiousness of an infected individual, \cite{champredon2015intrinsic}), which is different from the realized generation-interval distributions, is required to estimate $\Ri(t)$.
However, it was noted more than a decade ago that the required distribution to estimate $\Ri(t)$ can change due to interventions that reduce infectiousness in later stages of infection \citep{fraser2007estimating}.

To answer this question, we provide a mathematical framework that links $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$ with the renewal process of infection.
We show that the estimation of $\Ri(t)$, a counterfactual measure of transmission, depends on a counterfactual distribution---which we referred to as the instantaneous generation-interval distribution.
Likewise, the estimation of $\Rc(t)$, a realized measure of transmission, depends on a realized distribution---the backward generation-interval distribution;
the backward generation-interval distribution can be further expressed in terms of the instantaneous generation-interval distribution, which in turn provides a Wallinga-Teunis-like estimator \citep{wallinga2004different}.
Under strength-based interventions (e.g., vaccination, social distancing, and mask wearing)---which we define as interventions whose relative effectiveness does not depend on time since infection---the instantaneous generation-interval distribution remains unchanged.
On the other hand, under speed-based interventions (e.g., self-isolation and contact tracing)---which we define as interventions whose relative effectiveness depends on time since infection (therefore, speed of intervention)---the instantaneous generation-interval distribution changes.
Neglecting such changes can bias estimates of reproduction numbers (both $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$), including estimates of when they cross the threshold $\RR=1$.
Instead, we generalize the idea of exponential growth rate $r$ beyond the exponential phase and show that the time-varying growth rate $r(t)$ is a robust measure for changes in incidence under both strength- and speed-based responses as it does not require assumptions about the underlying distribution.

\section{Mathematical theory}

\subsection{Renewal equation framework}

The renewal equation framework provides a flexible way of modeling the spread of infection and the impact of intervention on the spread \citep{fraser2007estimating}.
Let $K(t, \tau)$ represent the infection kernel, defined as the rate at which secondary cases are generated at time $t$ by an individual infected $\tau$ time units ago (we will use $s, t$ to denote calendar time and $\sigma, \tau$ to denote time since infection throughout).
The shape of this kernel can depend on characteristics of the infection (e.g., variation in infectiousness over the course of infection) as well as other population-level factors (e.g., susceptible depletion, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and changes in behavior).
Then, incidence of infection at time $t$ caused by a cohort of individuals infected $\tau$ time units ago can be written as the product of kernel, $K(t, \tau)$, and incidence at time $t-\tau$, $i(t-\tau)$:
\begin{equation}
i_{t-\tau}(t) = K(t, \tau) i(t-\tau).
\end{equation}
Integrating across time since infection $\tau$ allows us to express the dynamics of incidence $i(t)$ using a renewal-equation framework: 
\begin{align}
i(t) &= \int_0^\infty K(t, \sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma.
\label{eq:renewal}
\end{align}
This formulation generalizes the dynamics of many compartmental models, including the standard SEIR model \citep{heesterbeek1996concept, diekmann2000mathematical, roberts2004modelling, aldis2005integral, roberts2007model, champredon2018equivalence}.

Here, we show that the dynamics of this infection infection model can be expressed equivalently in terms of instantaneous (counterfactual) quantities or in terms of realized quantities, meaning $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$ with their corresponding generation-interval distributions.
The integral of $K(t, \tau)$ across $\tau$ with $t$ fixed gives the instantaneous reproduction number \citep{fraser2007estimating}: $\Ri(t) = \int K(t, \sigma) \dsigma$.
If we normalize this kernel, we get a generation-interval distribution, which provides information about the time scale of transmission.
As with reproductive numbers, there are many different generation intervals; we call $g(t, \tau) = K(t, \tau)/\Ri(t)$ the ``instantaneous'' generation-interval distribution.
The instantaneous reproduction number and generation-interval distribution are counterfactual quantities: they describe quantities that would be realized only if conditions remained constant (i.e., if $K(s, \tau) = K(t, \tau)$ for all $s \geq t$).
The renewal equation (\eref{renewal}) can be rewritten using this decomposition:
\begin{align}
i(t) &= \Ri(t) \int_0^\infty g(t, \sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma.
\label{eq:renewal_instantaneous}
\end{align}
For example, if disease parameters remain constant in a simple model, we would expect $\Ri(t) = \Ro S(t)$ and $g(t, \tau) = g_0(\tau)$, where $g_0(\tau)$ represents the intrinsic generation-interval distribution \citep{champredon2015intrinsic}.

Now, consider the forward kernel $F_t(\tau)$, which represents the rate at which an individual infected at time $t$ generates secondary infections $\tau$ time units after infection: 
\begin{equation}
F_t(\tau) = K(t+\tau, \tau).
\label{eq:fkernel}
\end{equation}
The integral of $F(t, \tau)$, representing the total infectiousness of an individual infected at time $t$, corresponds to the case reproduction number: $\Rc(t) = \int F_t(\sigma) \dsigma$. 
The forward kernel, normalized by the total infectiousness, corresponds to the forward generation-interval distribution $f_t(\tau) = F_t(\tau)/\Rc(t)$, describing realized generation intervals for a cohort of infectors that were infected at time $t$.
\jd{I'm feeling like we should write $g_t(\tau)$ -- what's the reason $g$ should look so different from $f$ and $b$?}
Then, the forward renewal equation can be written as:
\begin{align}
i(t) &= \int_0^\infty \Rc(t-\sigma) f_{t-\sigma}(\sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma.
\label{eq:renewal_forward}
\end{align}
This forward renewal equation provides an equivalent description of the infection processes as the instantaneous form (\eref{renewal_instantaneous}) which is widely used in literature.
\jd{Which one is widely used?}

The forward renewal equation further allows us to confirm that the instantaneous quantities ($\Ri(t)$ and $g(t, \tau)$) match the forward realized quantities ($\Rc(t)$ and $f_t(\tau)$) when conditions remain constant:
assuming that $K(s, \tau) = K(t, \tau)$ for all $s \geq t$, we obtain $F_{t}(\tau) = K(t, \tau)$ (and therefore, $\Rc(t) = \Ri(t)$ and $f_{t}(\tau) = g(t,\tau)$).
In other words, $\Ri(t)$ and $g(t,\tau)$ describe number of secondary infections that an individual infected at time $t$ will generate, and when these infections will occur, if conditions at time $t$ were to remain constant.

\subsection{Strength- and speed-based interventions}

\begin{figure}[!th]

}
\label{fig:indpop}
\end{figure}

To model changes in epidemic dynamics, we introduce an intervention function $\II(t, \tau)$ which can depend on both calendar time $t$ as well as time since infection $\tau$. 
Then, the infection kernel under $\II$ at calendar time $t$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
K(t, \tau) = \Ro \II(t, \tau) g_0(\tau).
\end{equation}
Likewise, the forward kernel of an individual infected at time $t$ under $\II$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
F_t(\tau) =  \Ro \II(t + \tau, \tau) g_0(\tau).
\end{equation}
The intervention function $\II(t, \tau)$ can capture any kinds of epidemiological changes, including changes in the susceptible pools $S(t)$ (either due to natural infection or vaccination) as well as introduction and lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Here, we focus on two idealized interventions, which we refer to as ``pure'' strength- and speed-based interventions, and later generalize them to describe strength- and speed-based \jd{Did you mean ``based'' again, or ``like''?} interventions \citep{dushoff2021speed}.
While our primary focuses are instantaneous quantities ($\Ri(t)$ and $g(t, \tau)$), we first illustrate the impact of strength- and speed-like interventions using forward quantities as they describe realized transmission processes and are easier to interpret.

\jd{Maybe say ``change'' here instead of intervention, just when we make the point about the susceptible analogy. Or maybe this all needs to be addressed a bit earlier.} First, we consider a pure strength-based intervention $\II(t, \tau) = \PP(t)$, which includes susceptible depletion $\PP(t) = S(t)$ as a special case.
For example, a constant-strength intervention that reduces transmission by a factor of $\phi$ between time \tstart and \tend can be modeled as:
\begin{equation}
\PP(t) = \begin{cases}
1 & t < \tstart\\
\frac{1}{\phi} & \tstart \leq t < \tend\\
1 & \tend \leq t
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
\fref{indpop}A--C illustrates the impact of such intervention on the forward kernel $F_t(\tau)$ of an individual infected 5 days before $\tstart$, at $\tstart$, and 5 days before $\tend$.
Strength-based interventions are assumed to reduce transmission immediately (\fref{indpop}A);
likewise, lifting the intervention can, in theory, can cause the forward kernel to return back to normal immediately (\fref{indpop}C).
Even though the exact shape of the kernel $F_t(\tau)$ depends on the time of infection and when the intervention was introduced relative to the infection time, the relative impact of intervention in reducing transmission (black solid lines in \fref{indpop}A--C, representing $F_t(\tau)/K_0(\tau)$) is constant ($1/\phi$) as long as the time of transmission $t+\tau$ occurs during the intervention period: $\tstart \leq t+\tau < \tend$.

Such intervention has predictable effects on mean generation intervals:
implementing (lifting) intervention decreases (increases) future transmission potential and therefore decreases (increases) the mean forward generation interval (\fref{indpop}A,C).
If an individual is infected after \tstart (and much earlier than \tend), this intervention simply reduces the entire kernel by a constant amount and has no effect on realized generation intervals (\fref{indpop}B).
This observation generalizes the phenomenon of contraction of realized generation intervals due to susceptible depletion \citep{kenah2008generation,nishiura2010time,champredon2015intrinsic}.

Analogously, we consider a pure speed-based intervention $\II(t, \tau) = \HH(t, \tau)$ that depends on time-varying hazard of isolation $h(t)$:
\begin{equation}
\HH(t, \tau) = \exp \left(- \int_0^\tau h(t-\sigma) \dsigma \right).
\end{equation}
Then, $\HH(t,\tau)$ can be interpreted as the probability that an individual infected $\tau$ time units ago has not been isolated by calendar time $t$.
\jd{We could drop both of these ss., or just the second, and discuss more in Discussion.}
In practice, the hazard of isolation is expected to depend not only on calendar time $t$ but also on the age of infection $\tau$---for example, we expect $h(t, \tau)$ to increase with $\tau$ for symptom-based interventions to reflect the increasing cumulative probability of developing symptoms.
Thus, $h(t)$ can be interpreted as the effective speed of intervention, characterizing changes in the mean intensity of isolation.

\jd{I'm not against what you did, but I note that constant also works well here (you left it by accident). Another option would be to explain what we mean by constant -- that is, across age of infection but not necessarily across calendar time.}
For example, a constant-speed intervention that takes place between time \tstart and \tend can be modeled using the following hazard function:
\begin{equation}
h(t) = \begin{cases}
0 & t < \tstart\\
h & \tstart \leq t < \tend\\
0 & \tend \leq t
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
\jd{Maybe use $\theta$ for the specific value of $h$?}
In this case, the probability that an individual infected at time $t$ has not been isolated by $\tau$ time units after infection depends on the amount of time the individual has been exposed to this intervention.
If the individual is infected before $\tstart$, they will not be isolated by this intervention until after $\tstart$.
If the individual is infected after $\tend$, they will never be isolated by this intervention.
\fref{indpop}D--E illustrates the impact of such intervention on the forward kernel of an individual infected 5 days before $\tstart$, at $\tstart$, and 5 days before $\tend$.
Unlike the strength-based intervention, speed-based intervention does not show effects immediately;
that is, the rate at which an infected individual generates secondary infections at time $\tstart$ remains unaffected by the intervention because it takes time to identify and isolate infected individuals.
On the other hand, when the intervention is lifted at $\tend$, the value of the kernel at calendar time remains unchanged because some fraction of infected individuals have already been isolated.
Speed-based interventions always shorten realized generation intervals because they prevent late transmission (\fref{indpop}D--E).

Finally, we can decompose the generalized intervention function $\II(t, \tau)$ as a product of strength- and speed-based interventions: $\II(t, \tau) = \PP(t) \HH(t, \tau)$. 
Then, the dynamics of incidence $i(t)$ can be written as:
\begin{align}
i(t) &= \Ro \PP(t) \int_0^\infty \HH(t, \sigma) g_0(\sigma) i(t-\sigma)\dsigma.
\end{align}
In this case, the instantaneous reproduction number and generation-interval distributions are given by:
\begin{align}
\Ri(t) &= \RR_0 \PP(t) \int_0^\infty \HH(t,\sigma) g_0(\sigma) \dsigma,\\
g(t, \tau) &= \frac{\HH(t,\tau) g_0(\tau)}{\int_0^\infty \HH(t,\sigma) g_0(\sigma) \dsigma},
\end{align}
which allow us to express the renewal equation in the form of \eref{renewal_instantaneous}.
Therefore, the instantaneous generation-interval distribution changes under speed-based interventions but not under strength-based interventions, even though both types of interventions affect the realized generation-interval distribution.

\subsection{Quantifying changes in generation-interval distributions}
\label{ss:instg}

\jd{What is this lead-in supposed to mean? To model the renewal process we need no more or less than then bivariate kernel, right? Why is one particular component first?} In order to accurately model the renewal process, we have to be able to first quantify how the instantaneous generation-interval distribution $g(t, \tau)$ changes across time $t$.
The instantaneous distribution measures the infectiousness of an individual infected $\tau$ time units ago at time $t$ and is therefore different from the distribution of realized generation intervals (i.e., time between actual infection events).
For example, while both the forward generation-interval distribution $f_{t-\tau}(\tau)$ and the instantaneous generation-interval distribution $g(t, \tau)$ depend on the rate at which secondary cases at time $t$ are generated by a primary case infected at time $t-\tau$, $K(t, \tau)$, they are normalized by different quantities:
\begin{equation}
f_{t-\tau}(\tau) = \frac{K(t,\tau)}{\int_0^\infty K(t-\tau+\sigma,\sigma) \dsigma} \neq \frac{K(t,\tau)}{\int_0^\infty K(t,\sigma) \dsigma} = g(t, \tau).
\end{equation}
The forward distribution $f_{t-\tau}(\tau)$ is normalized by the average number of new infections caused by an individual infected at time $t-\tau$ (i.e., the case reproduction number, $\Rc(t-\tau)$).
On the other hand, the instantaneous distribution $g(t, \tau)$ is normalized by the sum of average number of new infections that an individual infected at time $t-\sigma$ generated at time $t$ (integrated across $\sigma$).
\jd{I feel like we've said this better elsewhere: it's normalized by the counter-factual \Rx: how many infections per infections if conditions stayed constant at time $t$.}

Rewriting \eref{fkernel} provides further insight into their differences:
\begin{equation}
f_t(\tau) = \frac{\Ri(t + \tau) g(t+\tau, \tau)}{\int \Ri(t + \sigma) g(t+\sigma, \sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{equation}
In particular, even if the instantaneous generation-interval distribution $g(t, \tau)$ remains invariant across time (i.e., $g(t, \tau) = g_0(\tau)$), changes in transmission conditions (therefore, $\Ri(t)$) are expected to change the forward generation-interval distribution.
Therefore, renewal equation models that rely on the forward form (\eref{renewal_forward}) but assume time-invariant $f_t(\tau)$ should generally be avoided.

On the other hand, if we were to take all realized generation intervals that end at time $t$ and form a distribution, we obtain what is known as the backward generation-interval distribution, $b_t(\tau)$:
\begin{equation}
b_t(\tau) = \frac{i_{t-\tau}(t)}{\int_0^\infty i_{t-\sigma}(t) \dsigma}.
\label{eq:backward}
\end{equation}
The backward distribution systematically differs from the instantaneous distribution:
\begin{equation}
b_t(\tau) = \frac{g(t,\tau) i(t-\tau)}{\int_0^\infty g(t,\sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma}
\label{eq:b1}
\end{equation}
due to its dependence on previous incidence of infection.
It also differs from the forward distribution:
\begin{equation}
b_t(\tau) = \frac{\Rc(t-\tau) f_{t-\tau}(\tau) i(t-\tau)}{\int_0^\infty \Rc(t-\sigma) f_{t-\sigma}(\sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma}
\label{eq:b2}
\end{equation}
\eref{b2} shows that backwards distribution can change even as forward distributions remain constant (or nearly so) due to changes in the contribution of different cohorts of infectors, reflected in $i(t-\tau)$, $\Rc(t-\tau)$, or both.
Several studies have noted, in various contexts, that backward distributions provide biased estimates of the forward distribution due to effects of this sort \citep{nishiura2010time,champredon2015intrinsic,park2020inferring,park2020forward}.

\subsection{Quantifying changes in reproduction numbers}

\jd{The initial assertion here is bold and doesn't quite feel right: speed-based interventions are not completely captured by \Ri, right?}
The impact of intervention can be measured by the instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$:
\begin{align}
\Ri(t) &= \int_0^\infty K(t, \sigma) \dsigma, \\
&= \RR_0 S(t) \PP(t) \int_0^\infty \HH(t,\sigma) g_0(\sigma) \dsigma.
\label{eq:rt}
\end{align}
Since $\Ri(t)$ measures conditions at time $t$, we expect to detect changes in $\Ri(t)$ as soon as intervention is implemented.
Therefore, it provides a real-time measure for whether the disease will continue to spread or not \citep{gostic2020practical}.

Estimating $\Ri(t)$ depends on the instantaneous generation-interval distribution $g(t, \tau)$,
which can vary across time under speed-based interventions:
\begin{equation}
g(t, \tau) = \frac{K(t, \tau)}{\RR(t)} = \frac{\HH(t,\tau) g_0(\tau)}{\int_0^\infty \HH(t,\sigma) g_0(\sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{equation}
By rearranging \eref{renewal}, we obtain the following estimator for $\RR(t)$:
\begin{equation}
\Ri(t) = \frac{i(t)}{\int_0^\infty g(t, \sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{equation}
While this estimator is similar in form to previously proposed estimators \citep{fraser2007estimating}, it differs in allowing for the underlying instantaneous generation-interval distribution to vary across time.
In particular, the popular R package \texttt{EpiEstim}, \cite{cori2013new} uses the approach while assuming that the underlying instantaneous distribution does not change over time; 
such methods accurately estimate changes in $\Ri(t)$ under purely strength-based interventions, but not necessarily under more general conditions.

\jd{This seems quite convoluted; I think I vote against the $p(t)$ interpretation.}
When both strength- and speed-based interventions are present during an ongoing epidemic, the classical estimator that assumes a time-invariant generation-interval distribution measures a slightly different quantity.
Given incidence between time $0$ and $t-\epsilon$ for $\epsilon > 0$, we can calculate the proportional reduction $p(t)$ in true incidence $i(t)$ at time $t$ compared to a counterfactual incidence value that we would observe at time $t$ if all intervention measures were completely removed at time $t$ (including the release of isolated individuals):
\begin{align}
p(t) &= \frac{\Ro S(t) \PP(t) \int_0^\infty \HH(t, \sigma) g_0(\sigma) i(t-\sigma)\dsigma}{\Ro S(t) \int_0^\infty g_0(\sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{align}
By substituting true incidence $i(t)$ in the numerator and rearranging, we obtain the classical expression for the estimator for $\RR(t)$---which we refer to as $\Rprop(t)$---that depends on the proportion of the susceptible population and proportional reduction in incidence, rather than reduction in infectiousness:
\begin{equation}
\Rprop(t) = \Ro S(t) p(t) = \frac{i(t)}{\int_0^\infty g_0(\sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{equation}
Despite its wide use, this estimator is difficult to interpret and does not necessarily serve as a threshold value.

\jd{Here's a different suggestion.}
When both strength- and speed-based interventions are present during an ongoing epidemic, classical estimators \cite{fraser2007estimating,cori2013new}  measure a slightly different quantity:
\begin{equation}
\Rprop(t) = \frac{i(t)}{\int_0^\infty g_0(\sigma) i(t-\sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{equation}
This is the number of cases per case required to explain current incidence under the counter-factual that the generation interval has not changed.
This estimator is widely used, because it is simple, often robust to estimate, and often a good proxy for \Ri.
When interventions are not purely strength-based, however, the exact meaning of this estimator difficult to interpret; and it does not necessarily accurately reflect how conditions are changing through time \jd{Do we need to think about threshold values? Nothing except $r$ is an instaneous threshold value, and everything is a long-term threshold value.}

The case reproduction number $\Rc(t)$ is similarly complicated. 
Since $\Rc(t)$ measures the average number of new infections caused by an individual infected at time $t$, we have
\begin{equation}
\Rc(t) = \frac{\int_0^\infty i_t(t+\sigma) \dsigma}{i(t)},
\end{equation}
where $i_t(t+\sigma)$ represents incidence at time $t+\sigma$ caused by individuals who were infected at time $t$.
Substituting \eref{backward}, it is straightforward to see that $\Rc(t)$ can be estimated by using the backward generation-interval distribution:
\begin{equation}
\Rc(t) = \frac{\int_0^\infty b_{t+\sigma}(\sigma) i(t+\sigma) \dsigma}{i(t)}.
\end{equation}
Here, the numerator, which represents the total number of infections caused by individuals infected at time $t$, is calculated by multiplying future incidence $i(t+\sigma)$ with the probability that future infections are caused by an individual infected at time $t$ $b_{t+\sigma}(\sigma)$.
Using \eref{b1}, we obtain a Wallinga-Teunis-like estimator \citep{wallinga2004different}:
\begin{equation}
\Rc(t) = \int_0^\infty \left(\frac{g(t+\sigma,\sigma) i(t+\sigma)}{\int_0^\infty g(t+\sigma,\sigma') i(t+\sigma-\sigma') \dsigma'} \right) \dsigma.
\label{eq:wtlike}
\end{equation}
This derivation clarifies that, like the classic estimator for \Ri, the classic estimator for \Rc\ is based on the n the instantaneous generation-interval distribution, and thus implicitly relies on the assumption that changes in transmission are strength-based and not speed-based.

This derivation also shows that, when the instantaneous generation-interval distribution is unknown, $\Rc(t)$ can be estimated from backward generation-interval distributions, which, in some cases can be estimated from contact tracing.
If realized serial intervals (i.e., time between symptom onset of the infector and the infectee) are observed instead, a similar calculation can be done using the estimated backward serial-interval distribution, to estimate a case-reproduction number for a different cohort: a cohort of individuals who developed symptoms at a given time. This is the serial reproduction number \cite{park2020forward}).
In contrast, the Wallinga-Teunis-like estimator \eref{wtlike} cannot be used for serial intervals because the corresponding instantaneous distributions cannot be properly defined \jd{I think this is what you are trying to say. Is it possible to explain concisely why they can't be defined?}

Some studies have suggested substituting the forward distribution $f_t(\tau)$, including the forward serial-interval distribution, instead to estimate the ``time-varying'' or the ``effective'' reproduction number $\RR(t)$ \citep{liu2018measurability, ali2020serial}:
\begin{equation}
\tsub{\RR}{forward}(t) = \frac{i(t)}{\int_0^\infty i(t-\sigma) f_{t-\sigma}(\sigma) \dsigma}.
\end{equation}
This choice is potentially problematic, as the forward distribution differs systematically from the instantaneous distribution.
In Section 3, we compare $\tsub{\RR}{forward}(t)$ with $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$.

\subsection{Quantifying changes in time-dependent growth rate}

The instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$ measures whether the epidemic will \emph{eventually} grow or decline if current conditions remain unchanged;
counterintuitively, it does not tell us whether the epidemic is growing or not at a given moment.
Instead, if we want to quantify whether incidence is increasing or decreasing, we can simply calculate the epidemic growth rate.
Researchers often focus on the initial exponential growth rate, but we cn look at the per-capita growth rate at any time:
\begin{equation}
r(t) = \frac{1}{i(t)} \frac{\dd{i(t)}}{\dd{t}}.
\end{equation}
By definition, incidence grows when $r(t) > 0$ (and vice versa).
Although this measure seems tautological, it is the best available measure for capturing whether incidence is growing or not at a given moment.

\section{Example: Semi-mechanistic SIR model}

In order to understand how strength- and speed-based interventions affect disease spread, we use a semi-mechanistic SIR model to generate synthetic data and compare various estimates of $\RR(t)$ and $r(t)$:
\begin{align}
\frac{\dd{S}}{\dd{t}} &= - \beta(t)S I, \label{eq:dSdt}\\
\frac{\dd{I}}{\dd{t}} &= \beta(t)S I - \gamma(t) I,\\
\frac{\dd{R}}{\dd{t}} &= \gamma(t) I,  \label{eq:dRdt}
\end{align}
where $S$, $I$, $R$ represent proportion of individuals that are susceptible, infected, and removed (either due to recovery or isolation measures);
$\beta(t)$ represent time-varying transmission rate; and $\gamma(t)$ represent time-varying removal rate.
We refer to this model as semi-mechanistic because the infection and recovery process are modeled explicitly, but changes in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are allowed to change freely over time.
In this case, the instantaneous kernel can be written as:
\begin{equation}
K(t, \tau) = \beta(t) S(t) \exp\left(-\int_{t-\tau}^t \gamma(s) \dd{s} \right).
\end{equation}
We see that changes in transmission rate $\beta(t)$ and removal rate $\gamma(t)$ match the definitions of strength- and speed-based interventions.
In particular, abrupt changes in $\gamma(t)$ will not affect the incidence immediately due to delays in isolating individuals.
Finally, the instantaneous reproduction number is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Ri(t) = \beta(t) S(t) \int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\int_{t-\tau}^t \gamma(s) \dd{s} \right) \dtau.
\end{equation}
When $\gamma(t) = \gamma(0)$, we obtain a familiar form: $\Ri(t) = \Ro S(t)$,
where $\Ro = \beta(0)/\gamma(0)$.

\label{fig:assumption}
\end{figure}

Here, we compare two different scenarios, in which interventions are introduced and are later partially lifted (\fref{assumption}).
First, we consider smooth introduction and lifting of a strength-based intervention, modeled by changes in $\beta$ while fixing $\gamma$ (\fref{assumption}A).
Next, we consider sudden introduction and lifting of a speed-based intervention, modeled by changes in $\gamma$ while fixing $\beta$ (\fref{assumption}B).
We refer to these two interventions as \emph{equivalent} strength- and speed-based interventions because they give identical incidence curves (\fref{assumption}C), demonstrating that changes in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ cannot be jointly identified from the incidence curve alone (see Methods and Materials).
In both cases, growth rate $r(t)$ estimates are identical (\fref{assumption}D) and provide robust measures for whether incidence is increasing ($r(t) > 0$) or decreasing ($r(t) < 0$); however, reproduction number estimates differ between the two scenarios.

\label{fig:sir_beta}
\end{figure}

Epidemiological dynamics under equivalent strength-based interventions are presented in \fref{sir_beta}.
In this case, the proportional reproduction number $\Rprop(t)$, which relies on the intrinsic generation-interval distribution, matches the instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$, which relies on the instantaneous generation-interval distribution (\fref{sir_beta}A).
Therefore, we are able to correctly estimate $\Ri(t)$ using \texttt{EpiEstim} (\fref{sir_beta}A).
The initial overestimation from \texttt{EpiEstim} is caused by the left censoring \citep{gostic2020practical}.
Minor differences between \texttt{EpiEstim} estimates and $\Rprop(t)$ are caused by discretization.

Likewise, we can accurately estimate the case reproduction number $\Rc(t)$ using the classic Wallinga-Teunis estimator (based on the intrinsic generation-interval distribution) (\fref{sir_beta}B).
This is because the instantaneous generation-interval distribution does not change over time under strength-based interventions (\fref{sir_beta}C).
Using the forward generation-interval distribution, instead of the instantaneous generation-interval distribution, yields smooth, biased estimates of $\Ri(t)$ ($\tsub{\RR}{forward}(t)$ in \fref{sir_beta}A) because the forward distribution changes, even when the instantaneous distribution does not change (\fref{sir_beta}C);
\jd{What's the point of this interjection? True in general? Interesting? Should we describe \Rprop\ in both panels separately?} instead, its shape better matches that of $\Rc(t)$.
As described earlier (\fref{indpop}A--C), introducing and lifting strength-based interventions cause the forward generation intervals become shorter and longer, respectively (\fref{sir_beta}C);
the backward distribution exaggerates these changes \jd{This confuses me. Is it clear in what sense backward depends on forward (rather than on shared drivers)?} it depends on the forward distributions as well as previous incidence.
The mean backward generation interval begins from 0 days in this case due to left censoring.

Epidemiological dynamics under equivalent speed-based interventions are presented in \fref{sir_semi}.
In this case, instantaneous generation-interval distribution changes through time.  
$\Rprop(t)$ differs from the true $\Ri(t)$ (\fref{sir_semi}A) because the speed-based interventions lead to changes in the instantaneous generation-interval distribution (\fref{sir_semi}C).
Therefore, \texttt{EpiEstim} inaccurately estimates $\Ri(t)$ (\fref{sir_semi}A)---
in particular, \texttt{EpiEstim} estimates that $\Ri(t)$ crossed the threshold $\Ri(t)=1$ later (around $t=55$) than it actually did (around $t=45$).

Using the intrinsic distribution is also problematic for estimating the case reproduction number $\Rc(t)$ (\fref{sir_semi}B).
The true $\Rc(t)$ changes sharply, reflecting sharp changes in the removal rate $\gamma(t)$ (\fref{assumption}B), but using the intrinsic distribution gives smooth estimates of $\Rc(t)$.
In addition, $\tsub{\RR}{forward}(t)$ matches $\Ri(t)$ and $\Rc(t)$ better than their corresponding estimates using the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (EpiEstim and Wallinga-Teunis in \fref{sir_semi}, respectively) because the forward generation-interval distribution captures the effects of speed-based interventions (\fref{sir_semi}C).
Surprisingly, the backward generation-interval distribution stays nearly constant because the effect of decreasing incidence (which lengthens the backward generation intervals) cancels out with that of shorter realized generation intervals, caused by speed-based interventions (\fref{sir_semi}C).

\jd{I feel that the main message should be not that $r$ captures whether things are going up right now (as measured by incidence specifically, not necessarily by active cases or FoI), but what measures capture current \emph{conditions} and time $t$. I think this is $r$ for speed-like changes and \Ri\ for strength-like.}
Under both equivalent strength- and speed-based intervention scenarios, we see that neither $\Ri(t) > 1$ nor $\Rc(t) > 1$ necessarily correspond to increasing incidence, $r(t) > 0$ (compare \fref{assumption}D with \fref{sir_beta} and \fref{sir_semi}).
That is, incidence of infection $i(t)$ can increase (or decrease) at any given time $t$ even when $\Ri(t) < 1$ or $\Rc(t) < 1$ (and $\Ri(t) > 1$ or $\Rc(t) > 1$).
Since $\Ri(t)$ is a counterfactual quantity, it does not describe what is happening at time $t$; instead it describes what can happen after time $t$ if conditions remain unchanged.
Since $\Rc(t)$ describes what happened after time $t$, it is also not a good measure for what is happening at time $t$.
On the other hand, $r(t)$ describes what is happening at time $t$ by definition.

\section{Discussion}

The impact of epidemic interventions are often characterized by changes in ``effective'' reproduction numbers, $\RR(t)$.
Despite historical emphasis on estimating $\RR(t)$, current frameworks neglect possibility that the underlying generation-interval distribution can change over time---an insight that goes back $>10$ years \citep{fraser2007estimating}.
Here, we distinguish two reproduction numbers---instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$ and case reproduction number $\Rc(t)$, which describe counterfactual and realized transmission processes, respectively---and show that both reproduction numbers can correctly describe the renewal process of infection when paired with correct generation-interval distributions.
In particular, a counterfactual generation-interval distribution, which we refer to as the instantaneous generation-interval distribution, is required to correctly estimate the instantaneous reproduction number. 
This distribution is affected by speed-based, but not strength-based, interventions.
Neglecting changes in this distribution gives biased estimates of $\Ri(t)$, including estimates of when $\Ri(t)$ crosses the threshold value of 1.

However, estimating the instantaneous generation-interval distribution is expected to be difficult as it systematically differs from the realized generation intervals: even if we can observe all realized generation intervals throughout an epidemic, estimating the instantaneous distribution $g(t, \tau)$ is not trivial.
For example, even within a homogeneously mixing population, in which the disease is allowed to spread unchecked (and therefore $g(t, \tau) = g_0(\tau)$ for all $t$), aggregating all realized generation intervals underestimates the mean intrinsic generation interval due to susceptible depletion \citep{park2020inferring}.
Novel statistical methods are needed to accurately estimate the instantaneous distribution $g(t, \tau)$.

Most state-of-art statistical softwares for estimating reproduction numbers assumes that the instantaneous generation-interval distribution does not change across time (e.g., \citep{10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16006.2,flaxman2020estimating,brauner2021inferring})---this may be the most parsimonious and best available approach given difficulties in estimating a counterfactual distribution.
We refer to these estimates as proportional reproduction number $\Rprop$ as they capture proportional reduction in incidence, rather than transmission.
This reproduction number estimate can differ systematically from the true instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri$ under speed-based interventions such as contact tracing.

In the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, assuming a time-invariant generation-interval distribution could have been justified during the early period given that most interventions were strength-based, including lockdowns, school closures, and travel bans \citep{flaxman2020estimating,li2021temporal,brauner2021inferring}.
Nonetheless, speed-based interventions, including intense contact tracing efforts \citep{park2020contact} and introduction of contact tracing apps \citep{wymant2021introduction}, had clear, non-negligible impact on the overall spread;
these interventions, including awareness-driven behavioral changes (which can cause symptomatic individuals to self-isolate faster), are likely to have shortened the instantaneous generation intervals by preventing transmission during later stages of infection.
Therefore, current estimates of $\Ri$ which relies on early estimates of the generation-interval distributions may be biased and reassessed.
Future studies should also consider incorporating hazard-based changes for modeling speed-based interventions.

\jd{This is confusing to me. We can't make too much of $r$ as a measure of whether the number is going up or down unless we talk about robust methods for estimating $r$ -- otherwise whether incidence is going up or down is the best measure of whether incidence is going up or down and the fact that we can translate that to the $r$ scale is a triviality.}
Our study highlights the value of growth rates $r(t)$ in characterizing epidemic spread \citep{abbott2020temporal,anderson2020reproduction}.
The instantaneous reproduction number $\Ri(t)$ tell us whether the epidemic will continue to grow if conditions remain the same but does not tell us whether the epidemic is growing or not at a given moment.
In contrast, $r(t)$ provides a robust measure of whether incidence is growing or decreasing at a given time under both strength- and speed-based interventions;
but it does not provide information about future epidemic dynamics.
\cite{parag2021epidemic} recently argued that $\RR(t)=1$ correspond to $r(t) = 0$ under correct assumptions about pathogen transmission and that $\RR(t)$ is theoretically more informative---however, we argue that this conclusion depends on their assumption to link $\RR(t)$ and $r(t)$ via the generation-interval distribution, an assumption that holds only when conditions remain constant.
As we show here, this is not the case when conditions are changing---that is, the sign of $r(t)$ does not need to correspond to whether $\RR(t)$ is greater or less than 1.
Time-varying reproduction number $\RR(t)$ and growth rate $r(t)$ encompass different information and should be used as complementary measures for describing epidemic dynamics \citep{dushoff2021speed}.

The renewal equation framework based on the instantaneous form (\eref{renewal_instantaneous}) has been widely used in epidemic modeling due to its flexibility.
A few studies relied on the forward form (\eref{renewal_forward}), but they incorrectly assumed a time-invariant generation-interval distribution \citep{nishiura2007time,alvarez2020variational,white2021statistical}.
As we show here, the forward generation-interval distributions, which change over time as transmission conditions change, correctly links the renewal process when paired with the case reproduction number.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to correctly link the case reproduction number with the forward renewal equation and to demonstrate the equivalence between the forward and instantaneous renewal formulations---
even when the case reproduction number was first introduced by \cite{wallinga2004different}, they did not explicitly link the case reproduction number to the renewal process.
Our study provides theoretical foundation for modeling epidemic processes.

\swp{Jonathan, can you try writing the last paragraph of the discussion?}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Equivalent strength- and speed-based interventions}

Here, we model a simple scenario in which a flu-like pathogen with $\Ro = 1.5$ invades an immunologically naive population using the semi-mechanistic SIR model (\eref{dSdt}--\eref{dRdt}).
We begin by modeling speed-based intervention and find the equivalent strength-based intervention.  
In particular, we assume that the disease spreads without any intervention in the beginning;
on day 25, an intense case isolation measure is implemented; and
on day 40, the intervention is partially lifted.
This is modeled as follows:
\begin{equation}
\beta(t) = 3/10\,\,\textrm{days}^{-1}, \gamma(t) = \begin{cases}
1/5\,\, \textrm{days}^{-1} & t < 25\\
1/2\,\, \textrm{days}^{-1} & 25 \leq t < 40 \\
1/4\,\, \textrm{days}^{-1} & 40 \leq t
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
Simulations are run for 100 days based on the following initial conditions: $S(0) = 1 - 10^{-3}$, $I(0) = 10^{-3}$, and $R(0) = 0$.

Since we assume that incidence is known exactly until time $t^\ast$, we can, in fact, estimate the transmission rate $\beta^\ast(t)$ (with fixed $\gamma(t)=\gamma(0)$) that gives identical incidence trajectory until time $t^\ast$.
This transmission rate is given by:
\begin{equation}
\beta^\ast(t) = \frac{\Rprop(t)\gamma(0)}{S(t)},
\end{equation}
where the proportional reproduction number $\Rprop$ is calculated from the incidence curve $i(t)$.
More generally, given true incidence $i(t)$ until time $t^\ast$, modulated by any combination of strength- and speed-based interventions, we can find equivalent strength-based intervention $\PP^\ast(t)$ until time $t^\ast$:
\begin{equation}
\PP^\ast(t) = \frac{\Rprop(t)}{\Ro S(t)},
\end{equation}
which generates an identical incidence curve when the initial conditions are identical.
