Can we talk about concrete vs. counter-factual instead of estimable or not? I feel the estimability is a red herring.

Can we call R_i R_i? Haven't we already discussed this?

I don't agree that people usually use (6): they usually don't notice whether they're using (6) or (12) or what (a point you try to make later). 

Do we really need F?
